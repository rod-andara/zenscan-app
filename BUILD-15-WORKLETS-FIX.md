## üö® Critical Issue Fixed: Worklets Version Mismatch Crash

### **Build 14 Issue (SIGABRT on Thread 8)**
```
Exception Type:  EXC_CRASH (SIGABRT)
Terminating Process: ZenScan [97626]
Triggered by Thread: 8

Thread 8 Crashed:
RNWorklet::DispatchQueue::dispatch_thread_handler()
```

### **Root Cause**
The app was crashing immediately on launch due to a **version mismatch** between JavaScript and Native parts of React Native Worklets:

- **JavaScript Side**: Worklets 0.6.0 (or newer due to caret versioning)
- **Native iOS Build**: Worklets 0.5.1
- **Crash Location**: `RNWorklet::DispatchQueue` on Threads 8, 13, and 16

### **Why This Happened**

We had TWO different worklets packages installed with **caret versioning** (`^`):

1. `react-native-worklets@^0.5.1` - Required by Reanimated 4.1.2
2. `react-native-worklets-core@^1.6.2` - Required by Vision Camera 4.7.2

The caret (`^`) versioning allowed npm to install:
- **Development/Local**: Exact versions matching native build
- **EAS Build Server**: Potentially newer versions from npm registry

This created a mismatch where:
- Native iOS framework was compiled with Worklets 0.5.1
- JavaScript bundle was trying to use Worklets 0.6.0+
- Result: `SIGABRT` crash in worklet dispatch queue

---

## üîß The Fix

### **1. Pinned Exact Versions**

**Before (package.json):**
```json
{
  "react-native-worklets": "^0.5.1",
  "react-native-worklets-core": "^1.6.2"
}
```

**After (package.json):**
```json
{
  "react-native-worklets": "0.5.1",
  "react-native-worklets-core": "1.6.2"
}
```

Removed caret (`^`) to force **exact version matching** between:
- npm install (JavaScript dependencies)
- Native iOS build (compiled frameworks)

### **2. Why Both Packages Are Required**

These are NOT duplicates - they serve different purposes:

**react-native-worklets@0.5.1**
- Required by: `react-native-reanimated@4.1.2`
- Provides: Worklet runtime for Reanimated animations
- Peer dependency: Hard requirement (build fails without it)

**react-native-worklets-core@1.6.2**
- Required by: `react-native-vision-camera@4.7.2`
- Provides: Worklet runtime for Vision Camera frame processors
- Peer dependency: Optional but required for frame processors

**Dependency Tree (Verified):**
```
zenscan-fresh@1.0.0
‚îú‚îÄ‚î¨ react-native-reanimated@4.1.2
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ react-native-worklets@0.5.1 ‚úì
‚îú‚îÄ‚î¨ react-native-vision-camera@4.7.2
‚îÇ ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ react-native-worklets-core@1.6.2 ‚úì
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-native-worklets@0.5.1
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ react-native-worklets-core@1.6.2
```

### **3. Clean Reinstall Process**

```bash
# 1. Remove all dependencies and lock file
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# 2. Clean install with exact versions
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# 3. Clear Metro bundler cache
npx expo start --clear

# 4. Rebuild native iOS code
npx expo prebuild --clean

# 5. Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# 6. Submit to TestFlight
eas submit --platform ios --latest
```

## üìã Complete Build History

### **Build 13 (October 1, 2025, ~09:00)**
**Issue**: Location services crash - `CLLocationManager.locationServicesEnabled` SIGABRT
**Fix**: Added `enableLocation={false}` to Camera component
**Result**: Still crashed (didn't address root Worklets issue)

### **Build 14 (October 1, 2025, ~11:30)**
**Issue**: Location permission causing native code compilation
**Fix**:
- Set `enableLocation: false` in Vision Camera plugin config
- Removed `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` from Info.plist
- Updated pre-build validation to not require location permission
**Result**: Still crashed (Worklets issue now exposed)

### **Build 15 (October 1, 2025, 12:07) ‚úÖ**
**Issue**: Worklets version mismatch (JS 0.6.0 vs Native 0.5.1)
**Fix**:
- Pinned `react-native-worklets` to exact `0.5.1`
- Pinned `react-native-worklets-core` to exact `1.6.2`
- Clean reinstall of all dependencies
- Cleared all caches
- Full native rebuild
**Result**: Expected to work! ‚úÖ

## üéì Lessons Learned

### **1. Always Pin Exact Versions for Native Dependencies**
When dependencies have native code (Worklets, Vision Camera, Reanimated), use:
- ‚úÖ `"react-native-worklets": "0.5.1"` (exact)
- ‚ùå `"react-native-worklets": "^0.5.1"` (caret)

### **2. Version Mismatches Manifest in Native Code**
JavaScript version flexibility can cause:
- Native framework compiled with version A
- JavaScript bundle using version B
- Result: `SIGABRT` crashes in native code

### **3. Clean Reinstall After Version Changes**
Always do full clean reinstall:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npx expo prebuild --clean
```

### **4. Test Locally Before TestFlight**
- Metro bundler should use same versions as EAS build
- `npx expo start --clear` before building
- Verify dependency tree: `npm list package-name`

### **5. Multiple Worklets Packages Are Normal**
- `react-native-worklets` (Reanimated)
- `react-native-worklets-core` (Vision Camera)
- Both can coexist if versions are exact and consistent
