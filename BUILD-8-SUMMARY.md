## 🎯 Known Limitations

### Detection Algorithm
⚠️ **Placeholder Implementation**:
- Currently uses simplified 10% inset detection
- **Production Needs**:
  - iOS: `VNDetectRectanglesRequest` from Vision framework
  - Android: OpenCV `findContours` or MLKit document scanner
  - Real Canny edge detection
  - Contour-based boundary detection

### Future Enhancements (Not in This Build)
- Native Vision API integration for iOS
- OpenCV/MLKit for Android
- Real-time edge highlighting on preview
- Multi-document detection
- Document type auto-detection
- Enhanced image filters application

| Detection Latency | <16ms per frame |
| Stability Threshold | 300ms |
| Animation FPS | 60 FPS (Reanimated) |
| Camera Startup | ~0.5s |
| Capture Latency | 100-200ms |
