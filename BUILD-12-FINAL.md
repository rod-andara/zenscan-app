## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### **Apple Submission Warning (ITMS-90683) - RESOLVED**
❌ **Previous Issue**:
```
Missing purpose string in Info.plist - Your app's code references one or more APIs
that access sensitive user data. The Info.plist file should contain a
NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription key with a user-facing purpose string.
```

✅ **Fix Applied**:
Added `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` to iOS Info.plist:
```
"ZenScan does not use your location. This permission is required by underlying
frameworks but location data is never collected or accessed."
```

**Why This Was Needed**:
Some dependency (likely in the React Native ecosystem) references location APIs even though the app doesn't use location services. Apple requires a purpose string for any API reference, even if unused.

## 🛡️ Pre-Build Validation System

### **New Validation Script**
Created `scripts/pre-build-check.js` to catch issues before building.

**What It Checks**:
1. ✅ **app.json Configuration**
   - Bundle ID: com.zenscan.app
   - Package name: com.zenscan.app
   - App name: ZenScan
   - Required iOS permissions present
   - Version number

2. ✅ **TypeScript Validation**
   - Runs `tsc --noEmit` to catch type errors
   - All type errors must be resolved

3. ✅ **Package Sync**
   - Verifies package.json and package-lock.json are in sync
   - Prevents npm ci failures during EAS build

4. ✅ **Required Dependencies**
   - Checks for critical dependencies:
     - react-native-vision-camera
     - react-native-reanimated
     - react-native-svg
     - react-native-haptic-feedback
     - expo-file-system
     - react-dom

5. ✅ **EAS Configuration**
   - Validates eas.json
   - Checks ascAppId: 6753142099
   - Checks appleTeamId: NA3TX7FRRT
   - Checks appleId: rodrigo.andara@gmail.com

6. ✅ **expo-doctor**
   - Runs full expo-doctor check
   - Ensures all 17 checks pass

### **How to Use**
```bash
# Run validation before building
npm run pre-build-check

# Run validation + TypeScript check
npm run validate
```

**Output Example**:
```
🔍 Running pre-build validation for ZenScan...

✓ iOS bundle ID is correct: com.zenscan.app
✓ Android package is correct: com.zenscan.app
✓ App name is correct: ZenScan
✓ iOS permission present: NSCameraUsageDescription
✓ iOS permission present: NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription
✓ iOS encryption setting: ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = false
✓ Version: 1.0.8
✓ TypeScript: No type errors found
✓ package.json and package-lock.json are in sync
✓ All dependencies present
✓ eas.json configuration valid
✓ expo-doctor: All checks passed

═══════════════════════════════════════
✓ Pre-build check PASSED
All checks passed! Ready to build.
```

## 📋 iOS Info.plist Permissions

### **Complete Permission List**
```json
{
  "NSCameraUsageDescription": "ZenScan needs camera access to scan and detect documents",
  "NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription": "ZenScan does not use your location. This permission is required by underlying frameworks but location data is never collected or accessed.",
  "ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption": false
}
```

### **Why Each Permission**
1. **NSCameraUsageDescription**: Required for Vision Camera functionality
2. **NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription**: Required by framework dependencies (not used by app)
3. **ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption**: false = No custom encryption, standard iOS only

---
